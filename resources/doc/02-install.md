## 1. Install NodeJS

## 2. Install NestJS Cli

    - To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).

    To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the Nest CLI is recommended for first-time users. We'll continue with this approach in First Steps.
    
    $ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
